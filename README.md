# Scriptable Computer Utils
Autocompletion and tools for the Scrap Mechanic [ScriptableComputer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2821133117) mod!

### /!\ Note /!\
Things may be outdated.
I do not regularly check out `ScriptableComputers`, or play Scrap Mechanic
If you want anything fixed/updated please [open an Issue](https://github.com/FlooferLand/ScriptableComputerUtils/issues), or a Pull Request if you wish to fix it yourself!

### - What is this?
Ive made this repository as the mod lacks any support for autocompletion by it's devs, so this should help! <br/>
I've also provided a custom script template that's easier to download/copy. <br/>
You should read more about it on my [discussion thread!](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2821133117/3768986428634401869) _(devs pinned it, so it must be good)_

### - Downloads
`PS:` To download a file you can download the entire repository as a zip. <br/>
Or, alternatively, you can click the clipboard button on a file _(the one next to `Raw`)_, select all, and copy paste it into a new file with the same name as the repository file.

- You can download the autocompletion file [here](./API%20Reference%20file/scriptable_computer.lua)!<br/>
  To use it, you simply call `require "scriptable_computer"` at the start of your Lua files. <br/>
  PS: I personally recommend you use [Sumneko's Lua extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) for VSCode,
  however, you should be able to use it regardless of IDE or extension.
- You can download my custom script template [here](./Better%20script%20template/script.lua)!<br/>
